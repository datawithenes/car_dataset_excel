# Car Dataset with Missing Data (NaN)

This repository contains a car dataset that includes several features related to different car models. However, the dataset contains a significant amount of missing data (`NaN` values) that may require preprocessing and cleaning before further analysis or model training.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of various attributes for each car, such as:

- **Make**: The manufacturer of the car.
- **Model**: The specific model of the car.
- **Year**: The year the car was manufactured.
- **Mileage**: The total mileage driven by the car (in kilometers or miles).
- **Price**: The current price of the car.
- **Color**: The color of the car.
- **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., petrol, diesel, electric).
- **Engine Size**: The size of the car's engine (in liters).
- **Transmission**: The transmission type (e.g., manual, automatic).

### Example Data

| Make     | Model   | Year | Mileage | Price   | Color  | Fuel Type | Engine Size | Transmission |
|----------|---------|------|---------|---------|--------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Toyota   | Camry   | 2015 | 80000   | 15000   | Blue   | Petrol    | 2.5         | Automatic    |
| Honda    | Accord  | NaN  | NaN     | 12000   | Black  | Petrol    | 2.4         | Manual       |
| BMW      | X5      | 2018 | 50000   | NaN     | White  | Diesel    | 3.0         | Automatic    |
| Tesla    | Model 3 | 2020 | 20000   | 35000   | Red    | Electric  | NaN         | Automatic    |
| Ford     | Focus   | NaN  | 65000   | 9500    | Green  | Petrol    | 2.0         | NaN          |

### NaN Data Overview

This dataset contains several missing values (`NaN`) in various columns, which may include but are not limited to:

- Missing `Year` values.
- Missing `Mileage` values.
- Missing `Price` values.
- Missing `Fuel Type`, `Engine Size`, and other attributes.

These missing values must be handled carefully depending on the specific analysis or machine learning tasks you are performing.

## How to Handle Missing Data

There are several approaches to deal with the missing data (`NaN`) in the dataset:

1. **Remove Rows with Missing Data**: You can remove rows that contain any missing data using a simple filter or cleaning method.
   - Example in Python (using pandas):
   ```python
   df_cleaned = df.dropna()
   ```

2. **Imputation**: You can replace missing values with statistical estimates like mean, median, or mode.
   - Example in Python (using pandas):
   ```python
   df['Mileage'].fillna(df['Mileage'].mean(), inplace=True)
   ```

3. **Use a Model to Predict Missing Values**: For more advanced techniques, you can train a machine learning model to predict missing values based on other available data.

4. **Leave Missing Data as-is**: For some machine learning models, especially tree-based models, you can leave missing values as they are, and the model will handle them.

## Dataset Cleaning and Preprocessing

Before using this dataset for analysis or modeling, you may want to clean and preprocess it. Some common steps might include:

- Filling or imputing missing data.
- Converting categorical variables (e.g., `Fuel Type`, `Transmission`) into numerical values (e.g., through one-hot encoding).
- Normalizing numerical features (e.g., `Mileage`, `Engine Size`) if necessary.

## Tools & Libraries

To work with the dataset, you can use the following libraries:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and handling missing values.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations, including handling missing values.
- **matplotlib / seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For preprocessing and machine learning models.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to load and clean the dataset using Python and pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("car_dataset.csv")

# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Fill missing 'Mileage' with the mean value
df['Mileage'].fillna(df['Mileage'].mean(), inplace=True)

# Fill missing 'Price' with the median value
df['Price'].fillna(df['Price'].median(), inplace=True)

# Alternatively, drop rows with missing 'Year'
df = df.dropna(subset=['Year'])

# Print cleaned data
print(df.head())
```
